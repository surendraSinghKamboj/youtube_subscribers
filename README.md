# Get Youtube Subscribers

The project creates a backend application with modular coding, using separate files for API connection and database handling. It offers three APIs for managing YouTube subscribers:

1. GET [/subscribers]: Retrieves an array of subscribers, providing a list of all subscribers.
2. GET [/subscribers/names]: Retrieves an array of subscribers, including only their names and subscribed channels.
3. GET [subscribers/:id]: Retrieves a subscriber object based on the given "id." If the id does not match any subscriber, it returns a status code 400 and an error message.

These APIs enable efficient management of YouTube subscribers through the provided endpoints.
